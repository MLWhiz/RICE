###How do scientific papers get cited? 

Our task for this application is to analyze the structure of graphs generated by citation patterns from scientific papers. Each scientific paper cites many other papers, say 20-40, and sometimes (e.g., review papers) hundreds of other papers. But, let's face it: It is often the case that the authors of a paper are superficially familiar with some (many?) of the papers they cite. So, the question is: Are the cited papers chosen randomly (from within the domain of the paper) or is there some "hidden pattern"?

Given that we will be looking at "paper i cites paper j" relationships, it makes sense to represent the citation data as a directed graph (a citation graph) in which the nodes correspond to papers, and there is an edge from node i to node j if the paper corresponding to node i cites the paper corresponding to node j. Since we're interested in understanding how papers get cited, we will analyze the in-degree distribution of a specific graph, and contrast it to those of graphs generated by two different random processes.
